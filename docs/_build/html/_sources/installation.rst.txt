Installation
============

The Andalus Judge server  is the central entity that runs the Andalus Judge web interface and API that 
teams, jury members and the judgehosts connect to.

.. admonition:: Requirements

    System requirements
        The operating system is Linux or another Unix variant. Andalus Judge has mostly been tested with 
        Debian and Ubuntu, but should work on other environments.

        It is probably necessary that you have root access to be able to install the necessary components, 
        but itâ€™s not required for actually running the Andalus Judge.

        A TCP/IP network which connects the Andalus Judge, the judgehosts, and the team workstations. 
        All of these machines only need HTTP(S) access to the Andalus Judge.

    Software requirements
        Python >= 3.6 

        A web server with support for Django >= 2..0.7 

        Postgresql >= 10.16 database.
